My SHAPE MORPHING Project 


Shape morphing using Delaunay triangulation is a computational technique that transforms one shape into another by leveraging the geometric properties of Delaunay triangulation. This method is particularly effective in preserving the structural integrity of shapes during the morphing process. The introduction of this technique often highlights its ability to ensure smooth transitions between shapes while minimizing distortions, thanks to the connectivity and spatial relationships inherent in Delaunay triangulation. This approach has found applications in various fields, including computer graphics, animation, and scientific visualization. It is especially useful for tasks requiring high precision and adaptability, such as reconstructing 3D shapes or morphing binary images while maintaining their structural features.
